## Description
A lightweight implementation of a database management system, similar to SQLite.<br/>

This project was part of an optional OOP class assignment designed to gain practical experience and see how different classes are combined together to develop a “real” software product.<br/>

The application handles basic SQL commands, enables faster lookups using indexes, manages files for data import, stores table structures to maintain the database state, and more.<br/>

## Commands
There are 20 avaliable commands, including a help menu and a sytanx menu that provide descriptions and syntax details for all commands.<br/>
They allow the user to create and manage tables, insert and update data, create indexes for faster lookups, retrieve data with select commands, and more.<br/>
