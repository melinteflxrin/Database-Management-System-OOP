## Description
A lightweight implementation of a database management system, similar to SQLite.<br/>

This project was part of an optional OOP class assignment designed to gain practical experience and see how different classes are combined together to develop a “real” software product.<br/>

The application handles basic SQL commands, enables faster lookups using indexes, manages files for data import, stores table structures to maintain the database state, and more.
